# Emotion Analysis

This code is still work in progress and intended for research purposes.

The German Polarity Clues data was taken from here: http://www.ulliwaltinger.de/sentiment/ and the emotion words are taken from here: https://bitbucket.org/rklinger/german-emotion-dictionary. The texts in the "Kommentare" folder were scraped from facebook via their publicly available API.
